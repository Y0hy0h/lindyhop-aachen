# Scenarios
These scenarios serve as a ground for discussing which features to implement and how. To keep the design real, always refer to these scenarios when deciding. If something is missing, add a new scenario. If something changed, adapt a scenario.

## Quick check
Hanna jumped on her bike to go dance some Lindy Hop. While at a traffic light, she realizes that she isn't sure if this week the social takes place at Chico Mendès or Sencillito. She drives onto the side walk, takes out her phone, and opens the Lindy Hop website.

The start page shows her that this week's social takes place at Sencillito.

Hanna is lucky to have looked it up now, because she needs to take a right turn at the next intersection.

## Passer by
Peter will travel from Romania to Aachen to visit his long-distance girlfriend. Since Peter will miss a Lindy Hop social in Brașov, he is curious whether he might dance some Lindy Hop in Aachen. He googles it and finds the Lindy Hop Aachen website.

He sees that during his stay in Aachen there will be two events, and he clicks on them for more information. He notices that the entry is free, but that he should buy some drinks at the bar, because they provide the room for free.

What a great deal, even though he has to pay a lot of drinks for his sweating girlfriend!

## Ambition
Naomi wants to try out something new. She already has a little bit of experience with Salsa, but she doesn't really like the music. However, she is curious to try out another dance.

Looking for options in Aachen, she stumbles upon the Lindy Hop Aachen website. There are some events soon, but she doesn't know which ones are suitable for her. She discovers the "Get started" page, where she is introduced to the community and sees some tips on what events she can visit to get a taste, and also links to other material on how to get started with Lindy Hop.

She goes to her first event, and will end up the greatest Lindy Hop dancer of all time!
